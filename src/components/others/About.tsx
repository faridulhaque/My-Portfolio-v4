          Hi, I am Faridul Haque MUrshed, a passionate MERN stack developer
          dedicated to creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. With
          a professional journey starting in October 2022, I have gained
          valuable experience working with reputable companies. Throughout my
          career, I have nurtured a strong drive for learning and growth.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite facing certain challenges in my educational background, I have
          proactively pursued my passion for programming. Through self-guided
          study and hands-on projects, I have honed my skills and acquired
          expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Redux
          Toolkit, RTK Query, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript. I am also
          familiar with jQuery, Express, Node.js, C, and C++.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in exploring new
          technologies and staying up to date with the latest trends in web
          development. In my free time, you can often find me engrossed in a
          captivating book, as reading has been a lifelong hobby of mine. I also
          enjoy challenging my mind with strategic games like chess, which help
          sharpen my critical thinking skills.
          <br />
          <br />
